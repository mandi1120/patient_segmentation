# Emergency Department Patient Segmentation <br>Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques  
WGU - BS Data Analytics Capstone Project  
Amanda Hanway - 3/2/2024  

## Introduction   
Visits to the Emergency Department (ED) generate costly bills for both the patient and their healthcare payer. In many cases, steps can be taken to prevent a potential medical emergency, such as taking prescribed medications and regularly seeing a Primary Care Provider for checkups. This project will focus on identifying patterns among individuals who visited the ED. The information which a healthcare payer can utilize to take actions that may decrease the likelihood for a future, potentially preventable ED visit.

The data for this project was provided by Synthea, an open-source, synthetic patient generator. The datasets mimic Electronic Health Records (EHR) to provide realistic (but not real) medical history for synthetic patients, enabling Health IT research and development.
